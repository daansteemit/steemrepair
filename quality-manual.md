# Quality Manual

Steemrepair has high-quality standards, but they are the reasonable and logical outcome of the biosphere in which Steemians work and write.

-----

## Basics

Steemrepair prefers bilingual or English written posts so that everyone can understand what is written.

The variety of thematics is welcomed.

The  plagiarized content, copy-paste, frequent shit-post or any spun/spinned content are forbidden by [Codex](https://github.com/aschatria/steemrepair/blob/master/codex.md). 

Steemrepair approves the usage of all STEEM applications and front ends. 

Source all images( even Free Attribution images), unless they are uploaded by you on the Steemit for the first time.  

Religious, gender, homophobic, racial or national bias is strictly forbidden in any text. 


## Quality measurements 

If not top notch, the text should be written at least in solid English and understood by the average reader. 

Length of the text: undisclosed.

### How to source images and why?

There are too many cases of copyright infringement and as Steemrepair wants to promote and support original content creators, the proper attribution is necessary not only by our standards but by the standards of multiple security teams that act on the Steemit.

Please adhere to these rules.

Attribution is not necessary for the Youtube/Vimeo videos or thumbnails, but every image requires a link to an original source either directly under it or in the footer ( Attribution links, box... etc).

**Example**

You will download a free image from Pixabay, upload it to the Steemit and give attribution to look like this: 

![Image example](https://i.imgur.com/gOrVWRe.png)
[Image attribution source](https://pixabay.com/en/example-for-example-z-b-2427501/)

Code for source is...
```[Image attribution source](https://pixabay.com/en/example-for-example-z-b-2427501/)```

### Where can you find free attribution images?

You can use ones on Pixabay, Pexels, Unsplash, and similar pages. 

You can also use this [Free Image Search Engine](https://aschatria.github.io/steem/freedownloads.html) to find images by topic. 

You can also swap codes like this and create a cover from a Youtube video.

If you need an additional help in formatting or shaping your text, you can use [Magic Clover](https://aschatria.github.io/steem/magic-clover.html) to do so.
